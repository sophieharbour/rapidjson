Enhancements
------------

The more important ehancements are tracked in individual feature branches 
with accompanying discussion in a local pull-request.  These feature 
branches are based on the current `svn/trunk` branch to enable individual
merging to the upstream repostitory.

The `master` branch usually has the features merged already.
This currently includes the following features:

 * [#2 - GenericValue: add copy constructor and CopyFrom] [9]
 * [#3 - User-defined double output precision] [10]
 * [#4 - Optionally accept arbitrary root elements] [11]
